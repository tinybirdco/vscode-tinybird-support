- Added: Execute arbitrary SQL in yout Tinybird workspace by selecting it in an editor and pressing the default `Cmd+Enter/Ctrl+Enter` keybinding or calling the command `tinybird.sql`. See the results in the `Tinybird SQL` output panel.

  > Note: you need to have your `tb` command properly configured for this command to work. Please, [refer to our docs](https://www.tinybird.co/docs/quick-start-cli.html) for a quick start.

- Added: Configuration keys:
    - `tinybird.dataProjectSubdir`: Where your data project is located in the active workspace.
    - `tinybird.venv`: If you use a Python virtual env to work with Tinybird, put the venv name here.
    - `tinybird.venvActivate`: The activation command for your virtual env (see setting `tinybird.venv`). Default is `bin/activate` but for some shells you might need another one (for example `bin/activate.fish` for the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/)).
